This is some random LED strip that I have in my house that I cloned the remote for.

They seem to be `Zengge LEDnetWF` LED strips judging from the Bluetooth signal they broadcast named `LEDnetWF0000334ED224`. I've seen [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integrations and a [reverse engineering effort](https://github.com/8none1/zengge_lednetwf) for similar devices.
